Let's call this version 1.00. :)
Just in case I make any changes at a later point...

A few notes about this:

(1) 
The entire document is configured using configuration.tex.
Just fill out all these commands specified there.
Additionally, adapt mainfile.tex according to your purposes. 

(2)
Compilation: execute the makefile. Read the PDF (Section 4.2 Building the PDF)
for further details.

(3)
The template folder contains pre-compiled PDFs. 
They are all (amost) identical, they just differ in:
* the title page layout (there are two different designs)
* the type of project (Honours thesis vs. 6 or 12 pt research project)
So, only the very first page differs; it exists in four versions.

(a)
Note that you can choose the layout of your preference (in the
above-mentioned configuration file).

(b)
Please, read this PDF completely!
It contains valuable advice on how to write a project report.
Thus, keep the pre-compiled PDFs so you can look up the advice at any later stage.
