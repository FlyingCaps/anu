Feel free to use it! I do not want it to be re-shared, i.e., you cannot publicly
make it available, but you may use it for the intended purpose, i.e., writing a
research project report.


Also note that whereas this template clearly has been created for theses at the ANU
it can of course easily be adjusted for other Universities. Maybe I will also make
it general enough once so that exchanging logos becomes even easier (though it should
actually be already *very* easy I think).


INSTRUCTIONS and USEFUL INFO:

(1) 
The entire document is configured using configuration.tex.
Just fill out all these commands specified there.
Additionally, adapt mainfile.tex according to your purposes. 

(2)
Compilation: execute the makefile. Read the PDF (Section 4.2 Building the PDF)
for further details.

(3)
The template folder contains pre-compiled PDFs. 
They are all (amost) identical, they just differ in:
* the title page layout (there are two different designs)
* the type of project (Honours thesis vs. 6 or 12 pt research project)
So, only the very first page differs; it exists in four versions.

(a)
Note that you can choose the layout of your preference (in the
above-mentioned configuration file).

(b)
Please, read this PDF completely!
It contains valuable advice on how to write a project report.
Thus, keep the pre-compiled PDFs so you can look up the advice at any later stage.
