Feel free to use it! I do not want it to be re-shared, i.e., you cannot publicly
make it available (other than a link to my repository), but you may use it for the
intended purpose, i.e., for your report, presentation, lecture slides, or poster.


Also note that whereas this template clearly has been created for theses at the ANU
it can of course easily be adjusted for other Universities. Maybe I will also make
it general enough once so that exchanging logos becomes even easier (though it should
actually be already *very* easy I think).

(The file AmnestyInternational.sty is used by the presentation as well as the lecture
 slide templates.)
